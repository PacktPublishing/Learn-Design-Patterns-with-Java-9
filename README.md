## About the Video Course
Instead of writing monolithic code, if you want to work wonders in terms of code delivery then this course is for you. Writing code is OK, but to write better code one should have the perspective of using design patterns to solve daily occurring common coding problems with proven solutions. 
This course will enable programmers to think not only in terms of code but also in terms of architecture and system design as a whole. Learning code syntax is easy and can be done by reading the documentation, but to learn about design and architectures and understand them thoroughly needs some serious effort and training
